# Documentation for Contact Form Code
This HTML code represents a simple contact form that can be used on a website. The code is designed to submit data to a Google Form, making it easy to collect information from users.

## Styling
The code includes some basic CSS styling for the contact form. It features a container with a heading that is centered on the page. The form itself has a max-width of 600px, is centered on the page, and has a box-shadow to give it a subtle 3D effect. The input fields and textarea have rounded corners, and the submit button has a yellow background color and a border radius.

## Scripting
The code includes a script that uses jQuery to submit the form data to a Google Form when the user clicks the submit button. It uses an AJAX call to send the data in the form of an XML object to the Google Form URL. The form data consists of the user's name, email, phone number, and message. If the data is successfully submitted, a message will be displayed indicating that the message was sent successfully, and the form will be reset. If there is an error sending the data, a message will be displayed indicating that there was an error.

## Usage
To use this code on your website, you will need to create a Google Form and replace the url in the script with the URL of your form. Additionally, you can customize the CSS styling to fit the design of your website. Finally, make sure to add the necessary jQuery library to your HTML code.
